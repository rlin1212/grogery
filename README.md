# day34-csp

Welcome back! I hope you all had an amazing Winter Break (and didn't make yourselves suffer by working on the Explore task over break....)

Your task is to use Python to:
1. Read in a FASTA file, 
2. Calculate the GC content (% of the nucleotide sequence that is either G or C) of each gene
3. Display the gene name with it's GC content. 

Within day_34_assignment.py, you will find an example showing you how to read .txt files in Python. 

This all seems pretty straightforward...but now we're also adding GitHub into the mix! In the file day_34_assignment.py, you'll find a series of questions that walk you through using GitHub. The guiding questions will rely on content we cover in class. Please answer those questions thoroughly in day_34_assignment.py. You should be jumping back-and-forth between your:
- command prompt,
- text editor, and
- browser (with your github activity pulled up).

Oh, and here's a useful reference: https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf

Have fun!



## About FASTA files
FASTA files contain gene names and their associated nucleotide sequence. There is an example FASTA file included in this lab's files. 

Don't be intimidated by the fancy file name - FASTA files are just .txt files formatted as follows:

\> Gene_Name_1\
ATCTTCCCAAGGGACCATAG.....TCAGGCAGACT\
\> Gene_Name_2\
ATCTTCCCAAGGGACCATAG.....TCAGGCAGACT


*NOTE:* Please do NOT edit the sample FASTA file on your computer, especially if
you have a Mac, because you may accidentally change the .txt file to an .rtf file,
which has lots of extra weird formatting.
